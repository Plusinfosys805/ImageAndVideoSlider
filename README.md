# ImageAndVideoSlider

This Android application provides interactive sliders for comparing images and videos in a before-after format. It includes two key features:

1. Image Comparison (ImageComparisonActivity)
   Allows users to compare two images side by side.
   One side displays the "before" image, while the other side shows the "after" version.
   A draggable slider enables smooth comparison between the two states.

2. Video & Image Slider (VideoImageSliderActivity)
   One side plays a video, while the other side displays an image.
   Users can slide between the video and image to compare changes dynamically.
   Useful for showcasing video effects, transformations, or before-after comparisons involving motion.
